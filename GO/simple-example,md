Here's an optimized version of your Dockerfile, ensuring minimal layers and leveraging caching for better build performance:

### Optimized Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM golang:<version> AS builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the necessary files
COPY . .

# Build the Go application statically
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o main .

# Stage 2: Run
FROM scratch

# Copy the binary from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main /main

# Set the entry point for the container
ENTRYPOINT ["/main"]
```

### Changes and Optimizations
1. **Static Binary**:
   - The `CGO_ENABLED=0` flag ensures the binary is statically compiled, eliminating dependencies on C libraries.
   - The `GOOS=linux` ensures the binary is built for Linux (the target container OS).
   - The `-ldflags="-s -w"` flags reduce the binary size by stripping debug information.

2. **`scratch` Base Image**:
   - `scratch` is an empty image, reducing the final image size to the absolute minimum (just your application binary).
   - Since the Go binary is statically linked, you don't need any libraries in the runtime image.

3. **Fewer Layers**:
   - By copying only the `main.go` file and skipping unnecessary files, the build process is more efficient and uses fewer layers.

### Build and Run the Optimized Image
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-go-app .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm my-go-app
   ```

### Result
- **Smaller Image Size**: Using `scratch` and optimizations, the image will be significantly smaller compared to using `alpine`.
- **Better Performance**: Stripping debug info and unnecessary files reduces overhead.
